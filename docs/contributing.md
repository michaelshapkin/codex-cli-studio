# Contributing to Codex CLI Studio

First off, thank you for considering contributing! We're excited to build this AI-augmented open-source ecosystem together. Whether it's a bug report, a new feature idea, documentation, or code, your help is valuable.

## How Can I Contribute?

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue using the "Bug report" template. Provide as much detail as possible.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement? Open an issue using the "Feature request" template or start a discussion in the "Ideas" category.
*   **Discussions:** Join the conversation in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/michaelshapkin/codex-cli-studio/discussions)! Ask questions, share how you use the tool, or brainstorm new possibilities.
*   **Improving Documentation:** Found a typo or think something could be clearer? Feel free to open an issue or a Pull Request.
*   **Writing Code:** If you'd like to contribute code (fix a bug, implement a feature):
    1.  Look for existing issues, especially those tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
    2.  Discuss your plan in the issue or start a new discussion before significant work.
    3.  Follow the development workflow below.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork & Clone:** Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2.  **Setup:** Follow the installation steps in the [README](installation.md), making sure to install development dependencies (`pip install -e .[dev]` or `pip install pytest pytest-mock`).
3.  **Create Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature` or `fix/BugDescription`).
4.  **Code:** Make your changes. Follow existing code style.
5.  **Test:** Add tests for your changes and ensure *all* tests pass (`python -m pytest -v`).
6.  **Commit:** Write clear, concise commit messages.
7.  **Push:** Push your branch to your fork (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
8.  **Open Pull Request:** Create a PR from your fork's branch to the `main` branch of the original repository. Fill in the PR template, explaining your changes.

## Code Review & AI Assistance

*   **CI Checks:** All Pull Requests will automatically run tests via GitHub Actions. Please ensure these pass.
*   **AI Explain (Experimental):** We may use `cstudio explain` or other AI tools to help understand the proposed code changes and facilitate review.
*   **Maintainer Review:** The project maintainer ([@michaelshapkin](https://github.com/michaelshapkin)) will review the PR conceptually and based on test/AI feedback. We value collaboration and will provide constructive feedback.

## Joining the Team
